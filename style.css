Hi [Person's Name],

I saw you deleted my comment on the "Revamp UI" Confluence page this morning.

I want to clarify my intent. The comment was to ensure a specific item—verifying that the "scale up the replica set" workflow is functional and reporting correctly in the frontend—is tracked and confirmed before we go to production.

I had raised this internally last week as it was not on the initial implementation checklist shared by Bippin. Since I hadn't received a confirmation on whether it would be addressed, I added it to the page for visibility.

I understand there may be a more appropriate place for this feedback. Could you please direct me to the correct channel? More importantly, could you or the concerned team member confirm the status of this item?

My key questions are:

Was the "scale up the replica set" workflow tested in UAT?

If it was not tested, what is the plan for handling it in production?

I just want to ensure we have a smooth rollout. Thanks for your help.
