Dear [Manager's Name],

As I prepare for my time off starting [start date], I want to ensure full transparency on the current state of the project and mitigate any potential misalignment in my absence. Below is a concise update:

Key Achievements & Current Status:
Release 001 Successfully Deployed in UAT (Keycloak):

Environment is open/running for testing.

URL flipped (Bippin can confirm access).

Data Migration completed for UAT.

Next Release (Pending Promotions to UAT):

Only latest changes/fixes from Dev will be promoted to the existing UAT deployment.

RBAC Permissions: Need clarity on which permissions should be:

Managed via solid ConfigMaps (platform-controlled).

Handled via UI (developer-controlled).

Action: Developer Leads ([Names]) and Platform Team will finalize this before July 19.

Production Keycloak Release (July 19):

Helm is NOT a blocker (UAT deployed via OC secrets). Helm enhancements are acceptable but not critical.

Docs are already deployed in UAT for reference.

Accountability & Next Steps:
Recorded Session: All decisions/discussions are documented in the [link to recording]. If there are disagreements, the team had the opportunity to raise them during the call.

Scrum Master/Manager Ask: Please help ensure any queries are directed to the recording or resolved via the existing plan. I’ve delegated pending tasks to [Names] for follow-up.

Non-Negotiables in My Absence:
No ad-hoc changes or scope creep without proper review. The UAT environment is stable, and the roadmap is clear.

If issues arise, the team should refer to the documented process or escalate to you/[Scrum Master]—not use my absence to revisit settled matters.

I’ll return on [return date] and will do a full handover then. For urgent matters, I’ve briefed [Backup Person] as a POC.

Thank you for your trust and support. Let me know if you’d like to discuss further before I leave.
