hank you for your query regarding the platform strategy for our new Linux VM request.

The rationale for requesting a legacy DEV Cloud VM instead of an OpenShift platform is that this environment is required for a Proof of Concept (POC) to certify new products. The specific tasks—installing, configuring, and testing Dockerized applications and running kubectl commands—require direct host-level access. This is necessary to simulate a bare-metal Kubernetes node and to perform low-level container runtime and orchestration client testing that is not feasible within the managed OpenShift environment.

This VM will serve as a build and test node for preparing artifacts destined for the strategic OpenShift platform. Once the POC and certification are complete, the resulting containerized services will be deployed on OpenShift.

The planned CTC Version ID to be installed on this VM is: RHEL9-X86_64-LATEST (or the specific RHEL version you require, e.g., RHEL8-X86_64-LATEST). This will provide the necessary base OS for our container runtime testing.

Please let me know if you require any further information to process this request.
