Team,

To fix the production OOM errors, we need the heap dump we discussed with the vendor.

Why: The dump is required to identify the root cause and create a code fix, not just a temporary config change.

Opportunity: This fix can be included in the upcoming release.

Action Needed:
Please provide the heap dump from a failing pod. Let me know if a formal task needs to be created for this.

This is a critical step to prevent further pod restarts.
