Hi , to action your point on proper testing, we need to highlight two key risks first:

Single Replica Risk: Running with one pod replicaset increases the risk of downtime.

Reporting Issue: The orchestrator is not reporting properly in OCP (names are blank).

Please advise how you'd like us to proceed. We'll hold changes in UAT until we have your direction.
