Hi Deb,

I hope this message finds you well.

This is Yon â€“ we worked together on the [Team/Project Name]. I really enjoyed my time under your leadership.

I'm reaching out because I'm looking for my next challenge within Citi and am interested in moving into a role focused on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or OpenShift.

Having been with Citi for a long time, I've built a solid foundation in our processes. My most recent work in the CTI area, along with my background in ICG and Digital, has prepared me well for a new challenge. I am eager to apply my skills in a cloud-focused environment.

I was hoping you might know of any potential opportunities that align with my experience. (And to confirm, I do not require sponsorship.)

It was great to say hello, and I'd appreciate any advice or leads you might have.

All the best,

Yon
