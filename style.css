I believe those must-gather images should already be mirrored in our internal Artifactory. To stay aligned with our internal sourcing policy, let's pull from there instead of running it imperatively from the external registry.

The internal image should be something like: artifactory.citi.com/.../rhdh-must-gathermain. I can help find the exact path. This way we avoid any potential proxy or sourcing issues.
