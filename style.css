"Hey [Scrum Master's Name], hope you're having a better day than I am! ðŸ˜… I'm hitting a wall and need your help to unblock this.

You know I'm deep in the product certification, and I'm really trying to stay on top of any production issues. Right now, I'm stuck because I need a heap dump to confirm this memory leak.

I've asked Arun about it three times now in the group chat, but I can't get a straight answerâ€”it's all "I will" and then nothing. I don't want to make it a big thing, but it's blocking me from getting the proof we need to loop in Vineet for a fix.

Also, while I have you, any chance you can pull in Mohamed for a quick status update on the QA team's stress tests? I need that info to complete my part of the certification.

Let me know if you can help nudge things along! Thanks, man."
